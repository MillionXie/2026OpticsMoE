# LGVQ GPU utilization: current selected-execution comparison

On 17 October, independent GPU utilization at YOLO B=3 and CLIP B=10 was remeasured using one loaded model process for each ascending batch sequence. All 11 predecessor/target batches and 33 complete repeats were retained. Only the two requested target utilizations replace the corresponding displayed annotations, regardless of direction. Accuracy, inference latency and energy were not remeasured in this utilization-only run: they retain their separately verified same-checkpoint, same-batch sources. Prior fresh-process repeats remain distinct historical records and are never pooled with this run. All other displayed utilization values, including finalized Qwen B=1, remain unchanged. The main display now caps YOLO at B=3 and CLIP at B=10 rather than substituting B=4/B=11. Current point means and repeats are shown below. Superseded repeats remain separately labeled in the raw-repeat workbook/CSV, never pooled with a later round. Main figures use B=1 plus at most two predeclared higher batches with pooled resident utilization ≥95% (largest tested batch if none qualifies). All other points remain audit evidence. The three workbooks and CSV identify displayed versus audit-only repeats. See the current comparison README for paired inference-cost data and the two figure descriptions.

### Same-process native reproduction (17 October 2026)

YOLO was loaded once for B=1,2,3. CLIP was loaded once for B=1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10. Every batch retains all three complete repeats. The terminal targets B3/B10 were required regardless of whether an earlier batch reached98%. No additional B4/B11 target or retry was substituted.

The measured loop is AST-identical to the original: resident first-B four-frame inputs prepared once, native same-stream queue8, each repeat ≥5s warmup plus a complete ≥30s window, all50ms driver samples pooled. All repeat process guards use one PID per model. Source/config/PT/manifest hashes and target input tensor/reference-output identities were verified. No Graph, weight/precision change, clocks/power setting change, training or highest-repeat selection was introduced.

The earlier98.76% CLIP B10 native control was interleaved with a candidate implementation after previous batches. This run uses only the prescribed all-native ascending plan and does not claim an exact reproduction of that interleaved history. The same-process profile is disclosed rather than silently pooled with the previous fresh-process round. One three-repeat run supports within-run reproducibility, not a guarantee for every subsequent run or machine state.

This is utilization-only. Original per-batch accuracy, timing and energy remain from their separately identified verified cost runs. New resident power is never used to recompute those costs. The finalized historical Qwen B1 is neither executed nor changed. The previous fresh-process observations (including YOLO B3 at87.15912898%) remain preserved, not deleted or relabeled as invalid.

All11 batch points and33 complete repeats are retained in the canonical sequential run and raw-repeat table with source roles. Only requested YOLO B3/CLIP B10 replace their displayed utilization annotations. Other B1 measurements are predecessor audit, not replacements of finalized references.


The measurement method is unchanged: first B TEST videos prepared/H2D once, original four frames, original precision, same-stream queue8, three identical ≥5-s warmup/≥30-s full measurement repeats, all 50-ms samples pooled. Each call processes B videos, not 8B. Driver-window utilization is kernel-busy time, not SM occupancy or a configured percentage. There is no CUDA Graph, synthetic load, best-window selection, clock change or new training. Qwen B3/4 change execution grouping/indexing under full558 exact-equivalence checks; the other models use native execution.

Qwen B1 stays at the finalized 63.133111480865225% historical one-repeat value and was not reexecuted. The earlier 71.17536071032187% three-repeat audit remains a separate historical record. Neither is a new same-round result. The finalized Qwen B1 costs are unchanged. Resident utilization and power are independent of the dataset-once cost experiment; resident power must not enter the cost formula.
